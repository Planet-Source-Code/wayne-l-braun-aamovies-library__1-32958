### Description

Demonstrates many common VB controls, ADO databound controls, Datagrid, and input validation in a VHS movies library. Hopefully demonstrates good code style.
 
### More Info
 
Although this is probably an intermediate application, it is felt that the beginner could benefit from studying the code as well. I welcome your comments at suggestions as well as help in bettering my code.
